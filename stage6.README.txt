6.1) Have you implemented all the requirements of this stage? if not, which are missing?
Yes, I have implemented all requirements of this stage.

6.2) Did you use any library other than those presented on the moodle page? if so, which one and to do what?
No, I didn't use any library other than those preseneted on the moodle page.

6.3) How do you detect that a given client is down?
I have used a 2 second timeout for hello-predecessor-q message. A timeout for hello-predecessor-q message indicates that my successor node is down, and I should start rebuilding/repairing the ring.

6.4) How did you support receiving messages and also handling timeouts to do stabilization, when the replies might happen at the same time?
I have used a 10 second timer (using timer library presented on the moodle page) and 10 second timeout for sending hello-predecessor-q messages and selec() respectively.
