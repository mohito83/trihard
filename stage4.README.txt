4.1) Have you implemented all the requirements of this stage? if not, which are missing?
Yes, I have implemented all features and functionalities expected from this stage. But I would like to inform the grader that at heavy traffic load the appication behaves weirdly, and you may have to run the executable few times to see the complete output.

4.2) Did you use any library other than those presented on the moodle page? if so, what one and to do what?
I havve used my402list.* files in application. These files were part of my CSCI402 assignment. And I have used them to implement a doubly linked list for saving data strings on the triad nodes.
