This package includes three files to simplfy hash generation:

sha1.c
sha1.h

together implement 
unsigned int projb_hash(unsigned char *buffer, int buffer_length);


Each student must fill in buffer to pass to this function
to compute the hash, using the details described in the specification.

A sample program to test this is name_to_id_partial.c.
It includes some framework code to call projb_hash
that you may use if you want.
You may compile that with

    gcc -Wall -o name_to_id_partial name_to_id.c sha1.c

and run it like this:

$ ./name_to_id_partial 1234 foo
(1234, foo) => a9367d92
$ ./name_to_id_partial 12346 foo
(12346, foo) => cba8f538
$ ./name_to_id_partial 1234 bar
(1234, bar) => f970bbc8

That is, after you complete the function nonce_name_hash.
